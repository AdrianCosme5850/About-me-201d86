      <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello and welcome to my page.  My name is Stephen Martinez.  I've been married to my beautiful bride for 10 years and have 6 wonderful children.  In my spare time I love to spend time with my family, watch movies, and craft (make paracord bracelets).  I served as a Hospital Corpsman in the US Navy.  There I learned a lot about life and grew as a young man.  When I completed my enlistment, I found a job in retail security  where I learned a lot about investigations.  For many years I worked different types of security jobs from retail loss prevention to executive protection, and just about everything in between.  Most recently I worked for a school district as a security and safety officer.  I enjoyed my time there working with students of all grades K-12.  I loved my job because I was not only a authoratative figure, but a montor to many as I was also a high school baseball and wrestling coach.  I was seriously injured while on the job back in 2019 and had to start looking for a new career.  A family member who is in the tech industry explained his job to me.  As my interest in the field grew, he then guided and mentored me to where I am today, A student at Codefellows!!  As I am still learning, I don't know where I'm looking to land, but but as the learning continues, I'm sure I'll find my path.  So far this journey has been both challenging and exciting, and I look forward to what the future will bring.  Thank you for reading!</p>
